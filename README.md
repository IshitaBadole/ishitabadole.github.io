# 🌿 My Personal Website

Hi! This is my personal website / digital garden / brain dump.

Right now, this is mostly:
- A quiet space to track my projects
- A showcase of sketches, ideas, and things I’m reading, watching, listening to, etc.
- A motivation to keep drawing and sketching
- A place to share things I’m learning and things I learned *later than I would've liked* 😔  
  (which could've been a tweet (xeet?), post, reel... but I'm scared of those so I’m making my own safe space (read: handcrafted echo chamber))

## ⚙️ Tech Stack

- Built with [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) + TypeScript + Tailwind CSS
- Hosted on [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/)
- Privacy-friendly analytics via [GoatCounter](https://www.goatcounter.com/)*

> \* The idea is to get a pulse on whether anyone’s visiting this space, and what they’re peeking at.  
> Could help me figure out what to grow next in this little garden.

## 🪴 Future Plans

- Add project diary entries with tags and filters
- Fill with cozy, self-drawn assets (cats wagging tails? coffee mugs with steam? maybe.)
- A sketchbook gallery of my slightly absurd ideas

🧶 This is still very much a work in progress, like me.

I’m overthinking it. But I’m building it anyway.
